# Problem 1

## Data load & tidying
This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help

Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary

## Plot
Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

# Problem 2

## Data load & tidying
First, we load the homicide data and do some data tidying. 
```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    state = toupper(state),
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", ") %>% 
    str_replace("Tulsa, AL", "Tulsa, OK"))
```

The raw data reports data on homicides in 50 U.S. cities describing the date, location, victim details, and case disposition. There are `r nrow(homicide_df)` rows/observations and `r ncol(homicide_df)` columns/variables after we create the `city_state` variable. We note that some state abbreviations are not completely capitalized and that there appears to be a typo for the city of Tulsa, so we fix these data entry errors. 

Next, we create a dataframe summarizing the number of total homicides by city and state, in addition to the number of unsolved homicides categorized by "Closed without arrest" or "Open/No arrest."
```{r}
number_homicide_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(number_homicide = n()) 

number_unsolved_homicide_df = 
  homicide_df %>%
  filter(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(number_unsolved_homicide = n()) 

homicide = 
  left_join(number_unsolved_homicide_df, number_homicide_df, by = "city_state") 

homicide %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Using prop.test
We then create a `myproptest` function to apply the prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved, apply the broom::tidy, and save the output (estimated proportion and upper and lower bounds of the 95% CI). We use `myproptest` for the city of Baltimore, MD and make use of the `pull` function.
```{r}
myproptest = function(number_unsolved_homicide, number_homicide) {
  
    prop.test(number_unsolved_homicide, number_homicide, p = 0.5, alternative = "two.sided") %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
  
}

baltimore = 
  homicide %>% 
    filter(city_state %in% c("Baltimore, MD"))

baltimore_results =
  myproptest(pull(baltimore, number_unsolved_homicide), pull(baltimore, number_homicide)) %>%
  rename(
    conf_low = conf.low,
    conf_high = conf.high)

baltimore_results
```

Now, we run `prop.test` for each of the cities in the dataset and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the CIs for each within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map2, list columns, and unnest.
```{r}
homicide_prop = 
  homicide %>%
   mutate(
    prop_data = map2(number_unsolved_homicide, number_homicide, ~ prop.test(.x, .y) %>%
      broom::tidy())) %>%
  unnest(prop_data) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  rename(
    conf_low = conf.low,
    conf_high = conf.high)

homicide_prop
```

## Plot
Finally, we create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city, and organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved homicides. We see that Chicago, IL, New Orleans, LA, and Baltimore, MD are the top 3 cities with the highest proportions of unsolved homicides. 
```{r}
homicide_prop %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf_low, ymax = conf_high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

# Problem 3

## Simulations
First, we set the following design elements:

Fix n=30
Fix σ=5
Set μ=0. 

We generate 5000 datasets from the model using `expand_grid` and call this `sim_df`:

x∼Normal[μ,σ]

In addition, we create a `sim_ttest` function to map to `sim_df` and save μ̂  and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0 using α=0.05
```{r}
sim_ttest = function(n = 30, mean, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 30, mean, sd = sigma),
  )
    sim_data %>% 
    t.test(mu = 0, conf.level = 0.95) %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    select(estimate, p.value)

}

sim_df = 
  expand_grid(
    mean = 0,
    iter = 1:5000) %>% 
  mutate(
    ttest_df = map(.x = mean, ~ sim_ttest(mean = .x))) %>% 
  unnest(ttest_df) %>%
  rename(
      mu_hat = estimate,
      p_value = p.value)

sim_df
```

We repeat the above for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}.
```{r}
sim_df2 = 
  expand_grid(
    mean = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
    iter = 1:5000) %>% 
  mutate(
    ttest_df = map(.x = mean, ~ sim_ttest(mean = .x))) %>% 
  unnest(ttest_df) %>%
  rename(
      mu_hat = estimate,
      p_value = p.value)

sim_df2
```

## Plots
Here is a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the power of the test assuming a 5% level of significance) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. As the effect size gets bigger, we see that power increases as well. 

```{r}
sim_df2 %>% 
  mutate(
    reject = if_else(p_value < 0.05, "y", "n")) %>%
  group_by(mean, reject) %>%
  summarize(
    num_reject = n()) %>%
  mutate(
    prop_reject = num_reject/5000) %>%
  filter(reject == "y") %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = mean, y = prop_reject)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line()
```

Next, here is a plot showing the average estimate of μ̂  on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. There is also a second plot (right) showing the average estimate of μ̂  only in samples for which the null was rejected (assuming a 5% level of significance) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis. 

The sample average of μ̂ across test for which the null is rejected is approximately equal to the true value of μ. As the error variance decreases, power increases.
```{r}
mean_plot1 =
  sim_df2 %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = mean, y = mu_hat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "All samples")

mean_plot2 =
  sim_df2 %>% 
    mutate(
    reject = if_else(p_value < 0.05, "y", "n")) %>%
  filter(reject == "y") %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = mean, y = mu_hat)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Samples for null rejected")

mean_plot1 + mean_plot2
```
